# Patchable UI

This library provides a set of standard components such as buttons,
inputs and arrays but gives the possibility to override their
implementation without changing their behavior.

The idea was to have access to a library of components without
thinking about their designs and to give the possibility to patch their designs later.

## Install

WIP

## Usage

In your application, use components from `@patchable-ui/base`:

```javascript
// App.jsx

import React, { useState } from "react";
import { Text, Button } from '@patchable-ui/base';

export const App () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <Button label="-" onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
      <Text>{count}
      <Button label="+" onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </div>
  );
};

```

##### Implemented patch

You can use the patch made with bootstrap:

```javascript
// index.jsx

import { patchWithBootstrap } from '@patchable-ui/bootstrap';
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

patchWithBootstrap();

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

You should see your button with the bootstrap style. üéâ

##### Custom patch

Create your custom component respecting the props.
(You have access to the props typing of each component in Typescript).

```javascript
// CustomButton.jsx

import React, { useState } from "react";

const CustomButton ({ label, ...props }) => {
  return (
    <button {...props}>
      {`üñ≤Ô∏è ${label}`}
    </button>
  );
};
```

Patch with your component:

```javascript
// index.jsx

import { Button, patchComponent } from '@patchable-ui/bootstrap';
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";
import { CustomButton } from './CustomButton';

patchComponent(Button, CustomButton);

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```
